<h1 style="text-align:center;">The Thinking Hats</h1>
<h3><p>Ever tried solving a maths or physics problem without knowing a proper  method?Imagine how difficult and terrible it can be.......

Similarly in life when we get a problem for which we have to reach to conclusions or find a proper solution we don't have a method to apply and get our answers.Hence leading to confusions,dilemma,anxiety etc.And if by some ways we decide a solution and unfortunately it goes wrong ,it leads to more stress and anxiety . So don't worry!! Here is a technique u can apply to and get most of your problem solved creatively-THE SIX THINKING HATS!!
</p>

<p>While applying this technique we will follow some instructions-<br>

*follow a proper sequence of hats...changing sequence may change the outcome<br>

*all hats must be used ...leaving anyone may not give desired solution<br>

*have a set of paper/pens/colour markers<br>

*if a group is trying to solve a problem mocking or making fun of other's ideas must be strictly prohibited<br>

* we don't need these colour hats in real it can just be drawn on a sheet of paper or we can imagine it in our minds<br></p>


<p>Lets take an example to understand how to use these hats to solve a problem.</p>

<p>Suppose we plan to renovate our bathroom.Bathroom is small it cant accommodate a bath tub and a shower cubicle at the same time.How we will decide to make a proper choice on renovating our bathroom using these options in the best possible way.........</p>

<p>1.WHITE hat</p>

<p>*its the hat that deals with facts or actual information we have about a problem</p>

<p>eg: -bath room is small<br>

      -only bath tub or cubicle can be used at a time<br>

      -80% of the world population doesn't posses a bath tub<br></p>

<img alt="" src="food123/h2.JPG" width="400" height="500" class="center">

<p>2.RED hat</p>

<p>*it deal with our gut feeling/emotion towards a problem</p>

<p>eg:-bathroom should feel amazing<br>

     -I should be able to get a peaceful and refreshing bath<br></p>

<p>3.GREEN Hat</p>

<p>*its the hat wearing which we think of creative ideas and solutions we can have for this problem</p>

<p>eg:-a bath tub with attached shower<br>

      -a shower cubicle with a bench<br></p>

<p>you can definitely add your own ideas to it!!</p>

<p>4.YELLOW hat</p>

<p>*while using this hat think about the benefits of using these ideas</p>

<p>eg:-bath tub with shower can give us a really relaxing bath in a lying down position<br>

    -bath cubicle with bench is cheap and uses less water<br></p>

<img alt="" src="food123/h5.JPG" width="400" height="500" class="center">


<p>5.BLACK hat</p>

<p>*using this hat we think of the negative impact our choice may cause</p>

<p>eg:-bath tub installation is costly and uses lots of water<br>

    -bath cubicle may fail to provide a luxurious bathing experience<br></p>
<img alt="" src="food123/h6.JPG" width="400" height="500" class="center">



<p>BLUE hat<br>

<p>*its the final hat which coordinates through all the hats and gives a proper out come</p>

<p>eg:-as my bathroom is small and i don't want to spend money extravagantly and also show a careless attitude of wasting water for my luxury i would definitely go for the "BATH CUBICLE" or would rather go for bath cubicle with a bench/seat for relaxing experience.</p>
