<p>Chop suey though may look and sound Chinese but it was invented in the city of New York in 1896. The story goes like, a Chinese diplomat named  Li Hongzhang when he visited the city was hosting some American guest for dinner. So rather than preparing authenticate Chinese food, he asked his chef to prepare some fusion food hence chop suey was born as an Americanized Chinese dish! So let's start preparing chop suey with our favourite Maggi noodles.....</p>
